# Content backlog

The flywheel inbox. Working on a build or sitting in a client meeting often surfaces a
content angle. Log it here as a one-line seed. Later, the `content-engine` skill turns a
seed into a drafted `/blog` post or a `/work` case study.

Newest on top. Format:

`YYYY-MM-DD · [source] · target · angle`

- source: `work` (something shipped/solved), `meeting` (client conversation), `idea`
- target: `blog` (post) or `case-study`

Voice rules apply to every draft: no em dashes, no jargon, short direct sentences, no
question hooks, never invent numbers. See the `content-engine` skill.
